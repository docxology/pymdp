## Epistemic Status
If the media were not already the message for you: this is a just-in-time live stream going through raw open source code. I know there are bugs as well as typos, incorrect/ineffective calculations and other errors. This is Speculative Realism embodied in chaotic large-scale code coordination (using Cursor 0.42.4 and claude-3.5-sonnet-20241022). Use these linguistic and computational symbols at your own risk and delight. If and as you are so inclined, you are invited to join our adventure and journey partially disclosed HEREIN: 

## Project Overview

### Core Concept Bundle
We are working on robust middleware that interfaces between core (active) inference implementations, and powerful, accessible, interpretable, semantic toolkits for synthetic intelligence engineering.

### Architecture Layers
1. **Core/Kernel Inference Implementations**
   - PyMDP (Python)
   - RxInfer.jl (Julia)
   - Machine Learning (various language)
   - Logical Reasoning (various language {JF's Symbolic Active Inference})
   - Biological, Soft, Active, and Quantum matter
   - ....
   
2. **Middleware Layer**
   - GNN interfaces bridging Inner/Meso layers
   - AgentMaker
   - FarmWorks
   - InferAnts
   - ....
   
3. **Outer Layer**
   - Systems of Interest
   - Real-world touchpoints & design interfaces
   - Domain adaptations mapping to the Meso/Outer layers
   - ....

### Key Analogy
**GNN+AgentMaker : Active Inference :: eBPF : Linux Kernel**

eBPF: "Dynamically program the kernel for efficient networking, observability, tracing, and security"  
â†’ GNN-AgentMaker: "Dynamically program the agent for robust and efficient inference, planning, and action"

## Analysis agenda
- Run_Biofirm.py and all it entails (tracing back layers)
- Generalized Notation Notation (GNN) and all it entails (tracing back layers)

### What Next?
- [Ideas from Livechat] 
- Open source... software, development, testing, deployment, education, security, theory, MathArt, and more.
- AgentMaker 0.11

### Development Framework
My preference is to do appropriate, relevant, open source contributions via Institute-scaffolded mechanisms. I do not (can not) understand the leverage, consequences of action, and safest future development of (these [open source {Active Inference}] projects). If you are passionate, curious, interested, please consider donating to the Institute (donate.activeinference.institute). We will explore new modes of software engineering, development, and deployment.

### Three-Tier Approach
_(From conversation with Vladimir Baulin)_

1. **Low Road** (Bottom-up / Minute Particulars)
   - Focus: Farm
   
2. **Meso Level**
   - Focus: Active Inference
   
3. **High Road**
   - Focus: Principles of Free Energy & Pattern-Potentiality of Living Matter
